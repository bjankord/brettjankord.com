<p>
  Hello, my name is Brett Jankord. I&#8217;m a front-end software engineer at <a href="http://www.cerner.com/" target="_blank">Cerner</a>Â in Kansas City, MO. I enjoy building responsive, performance-focused web sites. I also have a passion for <a href="https://github.com/bjankord/CSS-Coding-Standards">CSS architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bjankord/Style-Guide-Boilerplate" target="_blank">living style guides</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Along with web development, I enjoy spending with my wife and children, riding my motorcycle, listening to music and enjoying life.
</p>
