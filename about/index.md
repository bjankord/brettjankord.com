Hello, my name is Brett Jankord. I am a front-end software engineer at [Cerner](http://www.cerner.com/) in Kansas City, MO. I enjoy building responsive, performance-focused web sites. I also have a passion for [CSS architecture](https://github.com/bjankord/CSS-Coding-Standards) and [living style guides](https://github.com/bjankord/Style-Guide-Boilerplate).

Along with web development, I enjoy spending with my wife and children, riding my motorcycle, listening to music and enjoying life.
